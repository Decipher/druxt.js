The following documentation and stories are provided by
[DruxtJS](https://druxtjs.org) and the installed Druxt modules.

The stories are connected to your Drupal JSON:API via the DruxtClient; this
allows you to test your Druxt Wrapper components using live data.

## Introduction

This is a live Druxt Storybook, with autogenerated stories based on the
configuration of your Drupal backend.

---

### Autogenerated stories

Each Druxt module is able to use configuration from your Drupal backend to craft
site specific stories.

For instance, the DruxtEntity module will create a story for each Entity type,
Bundle and Display mode, while the Block module will create a story for each
backend Theme, Region and Block.

Search or navigate through the Druxt components and stories in the Storybook
sidebar.

### Druxt Wrapper theme system

Druxt components that extend the **DruxtModule** use slot based wrapper system,
providing the frontend developer the ability to create theme templates per
Content type, or Display mode, and many more component options depending on the
module.

The available component options are provided via the `component.options` data
on the relevant Druxt module component.
