# Druxt Storybook

> Druxt + @nuxtjs/Storybook

The following documentation and stories are provided by
[DruxtJS](https://druxtjs.org) and the installed Druxt modules.

The stories are connected to your Drupal JSON:API via the DruxtClient; this
allows you test test your Druxt Wrapper component using real data.

- For more information, refer to the
[Druxt Storybook guide](https://druxtjs.org/guide/storybook).

## Introduction

This is a live Druxt Storybook, with autogenerated stories based on the
configuration of your Drupal backend.

### Autogenerated stories

Each Druxt module is able to use configuration information from your Drupal
JSON:API backend to craft site specific stories.

For instance, the DruxtEntity module will create a story for each Entity Type,
Bundle and Display mode, and the Block module will create a story for each
backend theme, region and block.

### What is Druxt?

> Drupal + Nuxt = Druxt

Druxt is a framework for building Fully Decoupled Drupal and Nuxt.js
applications and sites. It allows you to leverage the content modelling and
management power of Drupal, and build elegant user experiences with Nuxt.js.
